# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

# WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I utilized a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

ANALYSIS

1) As we move closer to the equator, temperature gets warmer.
2) As you move North of the equator into positive latitude, temperatures drops. 
3) Latitude has no relationship with cloudiness and wind speed.
